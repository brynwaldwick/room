### Some useful stuff to try

* Check your inventory
* Inspect things to collect clues
* Move stuff or pick stuff up
* Talk to or interrogate characters. Ask them about your surroundings, maybe they'll help you or make you feel less alone.
* You can try complementing or acting like an ass to them. But be careful because you only live once (per game).
* Don't waste too much time on bullshit. It's probably just there to distract you.

Good luck.
